If you've received source code with this license attached, you are free to
build, run, and/or redistribute it. You are not, however, free to complain at
the author(s) or maintainer(s). Here are some examples of strategies to
alleviate any pain and suffering this requirement may cause you:

- If you think this code comes with literally any warranty whatsoever, fork
  off. If this code causes your house to burn down, your cat to poop on your
  keyboard, or billionaires to buy your website... sorry about that, but still
  fork off.

- If you think this code should do more or less than it currently does - fork
  off. Relatedly, if you think you've found a bug in this code, no you didn't.
  It's a feature. Fork off. Even if you think this software is usable somehow:
  fork off!

- If you don't like the author(s) or maintainer(s) of this project, or if the
  leadership style of this project is not agreeable to you - fork off. If you
  would rather the code be hosted on some other platform than you found it on:
  fork off!

If you email the author(s) or maintainer(s) of this code, you may, at their
sole discretion, be sent a complimentary copy of this license in response, with
a reminder to

_FORK OFF._
